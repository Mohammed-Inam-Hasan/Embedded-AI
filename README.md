# Embedded-AI
This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using a deep learning model in Python with OpenCV and TensorFlow, combined with hardware feedback via STM32 microcontroller. The system detects whether a person is wearing a mask and sends a signal over UART to an STM32G431MBT6 board, which controls green (Mask) and red (No Mask) LEDs.
